> We are in alpha stage until Gutenberg is merged into core. As features, APIs, and best practices change in Gutenberg, so will this plugin.

Demoify gives you more customization options that aren't found in the current set Gutenberg blocks ' like adjusting corner radius for buttons, applying the background color you like, and different styled dividers.

With Demoify: Blocks for Gutenberg, you get your essential blocks and more in a single install.

**You will need Gutenberg installed for this plugin to work**

= Minimum Requirements =

You’ll need the **Gutenberg plugin** for this to work. Once you’ve downloaded both Gutenberg and your copy of Demoify, install both on your WordPress website, activate them, and you’re good to go.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What is Gutenberg and why do I need it for Demoify to work?**

Gutenberg is a beta project by Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of WordPress. It’s a visual builder prototype of the new WordPress editor that’s coming out with WordPress 5.0 sometime this year.

Since it’s yet to be fully integrated with WordPress, Gutenberg comes as a separate plugin for developers and beta testers. Demoify is an add-on for the current Gutenberg plugin, so you’ll need both of them installed for you to use Demoify.

**Why would I need an add-on for Gutenberg?**

Currently, Gutenberg has some of the most basic features needed to create a website. However, we wanted to extend its current functionality by developing more options for designing and creating your Gutenberg-built website. Along with the additional blocks, Demoify also lets you change colors, edit text and shape sizes, and tweak your blocks styles.

**Can I use this add-on for other page builders I’m using?**

Nope. Demoify only works with Gutenberg.
